# Advance-House-Price-Prediction
### About the Project : Our task is to prdict the price of the house.
### In the DataAnalysis Part,I have done all types of analysis on features with respect to the output label SalePrice.I have observed the distribution of continuous features.I checked the null values in all the features and also analysed on what is the good option to fill the null values.I have also seen the outliers in features and seen their impact on  output label.
### In the Feature Engineering Part,I have handled all the null values in numeric and Catogorical Features.I have given labels to all Catogorical features.Also scaled the features and done FeatureSelection.
### In model building,I used xgboost and trained my data .I have seen other models also but Xgboost is working pretty well.
### Performance Metric : RootMeanSquareError is the performance metric I have used.
